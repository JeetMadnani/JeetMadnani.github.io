			<i><b>"Jeet has always had a passion for creating objects and design. As a kid he used to love to play with legos, and it was his favorite thing to finish a lego, destory and recreate it himself. He always enjoyed sketching and often used it as a way to relax himself. Though he lately has not had much time do unwind and draw, he loves it in any form, which is why his favorite class in school is design."</b></i>

					<br>
					This year, in Grade 10, Jeet had to complete an "E-Portfolio" in his design class. This was one of the 3 assignments he had to complete, in order to pass the MYP (the 4-year program he was in). For this project, he had to create a products that would help improve others' productivity. Therefor Jeet decided to create a table organizer for teachers in his school, as often they are so occupied that they do not have time to sort out their desk. This leads to clutter, which can cause a decline in productivity and affect their success in the jobs as well.

						This year Jeet was in his last year of his 4-year long MYP program. To recieve the ceritificate, besides having to take 5 eAssessments, and writing 2 E-Portfolios, he also had to do his "Personal Project". This is a project that last for 8 months and has to be worked on in the students' own time. The student may do it on any topic they wish as long as it fits one of the global context and they do the 4 steps (inquire, plan, create, and evaluate). Jeet chose to focus on eco-schools, and as his project, he created a scaled 3D model of what he would like an area in his school be redesigned too. As a result of this, he was approached by a club in his school, and as of next year he will start collaborating with them, in order to bring his plans to life.
