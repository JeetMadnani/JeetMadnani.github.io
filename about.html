		Though Jeet does not remember much of the moving process, he does remember the wonderful school he got enrolled to just couple months after moving. It was his first school of his schooling career, and it was a Chinese kindergarten. There he learned Chinese in school, and was being taught English at home. After just a few years, Jeet was relocated to the same school his sister was currently attending called <a href="http://www.utahloy.com/gz/index.php"> Utahloy International School of Guangzhou</a>, and little did he know that USIGZ was going to be his home for the next 10 years. Though many of the teachers and friends  left over the years, he will always rember the bond he founded and will cherish the memories made forever.
